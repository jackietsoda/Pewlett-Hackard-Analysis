# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After my findings, I determined how many current employees have reached retirement age. This will help the manager prepare for the "silver tsunami." 

## Results
**1.**
This table shows the Retiring Titles. Out of the 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement, 63.8% of them hold a "senior" position. To fill these positions once the employees leave, the company will either have to promote other employees within the company or hire new people.

**2.**
This table shows the Unique Titles. We can see more in depth the employee number, employee first and last name, and what position they work. Having this information will help the manager have a more detailed analysis on who could be retiring soon and the role they would need to fill.

**3.**
This table shows the Retirement Titles. We can see when the employees started and, for some of them, when their last day will be. This will help the manager have a more visual timeline of when these positions will be vacant and they can be more prepared for the "silver tsunami."

**4.**
Only 1,549 employees are eligible to join the mentorship program. This is only 1.7% of employees who are eligible for retirement. Those who join the mentorship program can share knowledge and encouragement to their colleagues.

## Summary
**- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

A little over 90,000 people are eligible for retirement, so these roles will eventually need to be filled.

**- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

There are very little retirement-ready employees (1,549) to mentor the next generation of employees, so this will make the transition quite difficult.
